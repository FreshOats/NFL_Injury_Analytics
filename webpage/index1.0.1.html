                    In recent years, more concern has grown over sustained injuries that impact the athletes lives long after their athletic career ends. The NFL is looking to identify what changes should be made to minimize the risk of player injury, while not completely altering America's favorite pastime. There are several types of injuries that are incurred - there are gross physiological injuries such as knee, foot, and ankle injuries, and there are also more subtle injuries such as concussions, which can have a much longer-lasting impact on the players, occasionally leading to personality changes and unfortanately, even suicide. It's clear that changes need to be made to address these concerns, but the conflicting view is that the NFL is a multi-billion dollar industry, generating a revenue of over 17 billion dollars in 2021 alone. While changes need to be made, they only impact a fraction of the players. In order to minimize the risk of all players, it's important for the NFL to maintain most of the features of the game if they can modify only certain aspects in order to better ensure the medical safety of their players.

                    The purpose of this analysis is to identify the aspects of the game that best predict the occurrence of injury, whether it is a short-term injury, long-term injury, or a traumatic brain injury. Unsupervised analysis is initially used to identify clusters in the data, and which predictors may have a greater influence on the injuries. Following this, supervised analysis is used to predict the conditions that can lead to such short-term, long-term, and traumatic brain injuries using the data provided by the NFL via 2 Kaggle Competitions.</p>
